<h1>Giving real estate</h1>

<p class="lead">Shasta Regional Community Real Estate Foundation is here to help.</p>

<p>The greatest wealth in our region is in our land. A donation of real estate may allow you to make a bigger charitable difference than you ever thought possible.</p>
<p>You can give the property outright. Because we?re a public charity, you?ll receive a deduction for the full fair market value of the donation, rather than just the cost basis. You can also give the property as a bequest.</p>
<p>You can retain lifetime use. We can structure the donation to allow you to use and enjoy the property for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>You can generate income for yourself or others. With a charitable remainder or lead trust, you can produce income now for yourself, your beneficiary, or charity? and still receive a deduction for a portion of the asset you donate.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<ul>
	<li>You identify real estate property that you would like to give; an appraisal will help you establish its estimated market value.</li>
	<li>We assess the real estate for compliance with our acceptance policies and gather appropriate documentation.</li>
	<li>We handle all the administrative details, from appraisal to inspections to title work. With donations of real estate, your property gains translate into community impact, so you get a more rewarding return on a major asset.</li>
	<li>Your donation can be placed in any of our charitable funds in your name, in the name of your family or business, or in honor of any person or organization you choose.</li>
	<li>Your donation can be endowed and invested over time. Earnings from your fund are used to make grants addressing community needs. Your donation?and all future earnings from the asset?become a permanent source of community capital, helping to do good work forever.</li>
</ul>
