<h1>Start charitable conversations</h1>

<p class="lead"><em>Why should you talk to your clients about giving?</em></p>

<p>You can help clients realize their charitable goals by listening for charitable giving opportunities, explaining options, and suggesting solutions. Significant giving opportunities often arise when clients are making major business, personal, and financial decisions.

<dl class="dl-horizontal">

<dt>Year-end tax planning</dt>
<dd>Your client just earned a large bonus and wants to give a portion back to the community, but has no time to decide on the most deserving charities. Recommend establishing a donor advised fund through Shasta Regional Community Foundation for an immediate tax deduction, and the ability to stay involved in recommending uses for the gift for years to come.</dd>

<dt>Preserving an estate</dt>
<dd>Estate planning identifies significant taxes going to the IRS, but your client wants to direct dollars for local benefit. The Community Foundation can work with you and your client to reduce her taxable estate through a charitable bequest or other planned gift. Your client’s gift will create a legacy of caring in the community that stays true to her charitable intent forever.</dd>

<dt>Retiring in comfort</dt>
<dd>Your client is concerned about running out of money during her lifetime, but has always been charitable. Recommend establishing a life income gift (such as a charitable remainder trust) at the Community Foundation that pays income potentially for life. Upon your client’s death, the gift can be distributed by the Community Foundation in accordance with her charitable interests.</dd>

<dt>Establishing a private foundation</dt>
<dd>Your client is thinking about establishing a private foundation, but is looking for a simpler, more cost-efficient alternative. The Community Foundation can help you and your client analyze the pros and cons of creating a donor advised fund or a private foundation.</dd>

<dt>Closely held stock</dt>
<dd>Your client’s personal net worth is primarily tied up in a closely held company, but it’s important for her to give back to the community. Recommend establishing a donor advised fund or planned gift; your client is eligible for a tax deduction measured by the fair market value of appreciated stock (less any planned gift value).</dd>

<dt>Sale or disposition of highly appreciated stock</dt>
<dd>Your client has appreciated stock and wants to use a portion of the gains for charitable giving, but the identified charities are too small to accept direct stock gifts. Suggest establishing a fund at the Community Foundation with a gift of appreciated stock. Your client receives a tax deduction on the full market value, while avoiding the capital gains tax that would otherwise arise from sale of the stock. Your client can even be involved in recommending uses for the gift, including the organizations and programs he or she cares about most.  Through our American Funds Program you can maintain your relationship with your client and earn commission on assets that are invested by the Community Foundation in American Funds.</dd>

<dt>Sale of a business</dt>
<dd>Your client owns highly appreciated stock in a company that is about to be acquired. The Community Foundation can work with you to suggest several ways to structure a charitable gift (including the use of planned giving techniques) to help your client reduce capital gains tax and maximize impact to the community.</dd>

<dt>Strategic giving</dt>
<dd>Your client is passionate about helping meet a specific community need and wants to make a meaningful gift. You and your client can work with our grantmaking experts to understand community needs and programs and then direct gift dollars to make the greatest impact.</dd>

<dt>Substantial IRA/401(k) assets</dt>
<dd>Your client wants to leave her estate to community and family, and has substantial assets in retirement accounts. The Community Foundation can help you and your client evaluate the most beneficial asset distribution to minimize taxes, giving more to her heirs and preserving charitable intent.</dd>

<dt>Real estate</dt>
<dd>Your client owns a vacation home that hasn't been used in 10 years, and would like to deduct its full market value as a charitable contribution. The Community Foundation, through the Shasta Regional Community Real Estate Foundation, can help you assess possibilities for this gift transaction.</dd>
