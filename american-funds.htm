<h1>American Funds and Shasta Regional Community Foundation</h1>

<p class="lead"><em>Benefit your clients, your community and yourself...</em></p>

<p>American Funds has established a program that allows your clients to make a difference in the community while meeting their financial needs while allowing you to continue to earn commissions and service fees.</p>
<p>The Shasta Regional Community Foundation is proud to offer this program and to partner with the financial advisors in our region in building assets for our community.</p>

<h2>How it works:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Any financial advisor who uses American Funds may refer a client to the Community Foundation and utilize the American Funds Community Foundation program.</li>
	<li>We will partner with you and your client to explore their charitable interests and identify a giving structure that fits with the client’s overall estate and financial planning needs.</li>
	<li>Your client can establish a fund at the Community Foundation or give to an existing fund in a number of ways, including cash, real estate, securities and other assets.</li>
	<li>You earn commission on assets you bring to the Community Foundation.</li>
	<li>The Community Foundation becomes the legal owner of the charitable asset, but contracts with American Funds to manage them in accordance with the chosen asset allocation model.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits of Participating:</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Maintain Your Client Relationship</dt>
<dd>You earn a commission on assets that are invested by the Community Foundation in American Funds.  In addition, after assets are invested for 12 months, you will receive an annual service fee for as long as those assets remain invested in American Funds with you as the financial advisor on record.  And, the commissions and service fees are paid directly from American Funds, so your client’s Fund balance is not impacted.</dd>
