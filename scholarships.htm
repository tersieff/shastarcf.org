<p>Shasta Regional Community Foundation manages many scholarship funds that are awarded to graduating seniors from area high schools each year. Many of these scholarships are also renewable for college students. Some scholarships were started by families or individuals; others by businesses or organizations. All scholarships share one goal: helping young people reach their educational goals.</p>
